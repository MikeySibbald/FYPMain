Final Year Image Recognition
This project uses Tensorflow and Keras to create a model for image recognition.
This model accepts a sample number of images of LEGO bricks and returns the user the pricing of each brick from
the lego pick-a-brick website. This price is collected from the website using selenium to search the website and scrape the price.

The LegoRec4TestClass uses the trained model and therefore must be in the same directory as the .h5 files and the chromedriver.exe file

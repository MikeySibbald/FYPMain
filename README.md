Final Year Image Recognition
This project uses Tensorflow and Keras to create a model for image recognition.
This model accepts a sample number of images of LEGO bricks and returns the user the pricing of each brick from
the lego pick-a-brick website. This price is collected from the website using selenium to search the website and scrape the price.
